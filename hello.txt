Hello world!


Paper and sticks and shovel and match
Why won"t the news of the old world catch
and the fire in a temper start?

Woop-woop! That’s the sound of da police.
Woop-woop! That’s the sound of da beast.

I had a rich boy all to myself
I loved his money and navy wealth
and I lived in his purse and his heart
