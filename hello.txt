Hello world!


Paper and sticks and shovel and match
Why won"t the news of the old world catch
and the fire in a temper start?

Woop-woop! That’s the sound of da police.
Woop-woop! That’s the sound of da beast.





I was flying into Chicago at night
Watching the lake turn the sky into blue-green smoke
The sun was setting to the left of the plane
And the cabin was filled with an unearthly glow
In 27-D, I was behind the wing
Watching landscape roll out like credits on a screen

The earth looked like it was lit from within
Like a poorly assembled electrical ball
As we moved out of the farmlands into the grid
The plan of a city was all that you saw
And all of these people sitting totally still
As the ground raced beneath them, thirty-thousand feet down

It took an hour, maybe a day
But once I really listened the noise just fell away


I had a rich boy all to myself
I loved his money and navy wealth
and I lived in his purse and his heart
